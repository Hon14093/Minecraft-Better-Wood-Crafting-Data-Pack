- Crafting recipes for wood barks create 4 instead of 3.
- Crafting recipes for wood fences create 9 instead of 3.
- Crafting recipes for wood trapdoors create 16 instead of 2.

## 3. Installation
1. Extract the zip file and copy it.
2. Locate your Minecraft files (Windows + R -> ```appdata``` -> ```Roaming``` -> ```.minecraft``` or the launcher you're using).
4. Open ```saves``` -> The world you want to use -> ```datapacks```.
5. Paste the copied file into ```datapacks``` then open Minecraft and play!

### NOTE:
- I also added a furnace recipe for smelting rotten flesh into leather.
- If you're making your first data pack and running into a problem that you can't override vanilla recipe, make sure to also have ```.mcassetsroot``` file somewhere in your pack.
